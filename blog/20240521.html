          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p><b>thebelovedmoon, G.Mgr of #MamaNyoSquad.</b></p>
          <p>
            These past few weeks have been a very hectic experience with regards to
            multitasking and a lot of stuff -- especially when it comes to VTubing
            activities. Despite that, though, I remain committed to my other works;
            especially this one.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've given it some thought about what would be the future of the Squad and its
            underlying framework, and I'm excited to share you the next steps in order to
            [hopefully] make use of this platform even more.
          </p>
          <h2>Website Design</h2>
          <p>
            Recently, I've taken on a new task of trying to update the website's design
            language, seeing as I'm already making progress in the other projects that I
            had on my disposal. One of them happened to be my own website
            <code>thebelovedmoon.github.io</code>, where I attempt to update its design
            following the 2024 framework for my VTubing activities. (It's worth noting
            that I've gone the route similar to the Marias' design language for a unified
            experience at large, and have it integrated with the others while I'm at it.)
          </p>
          <p>
            With that in mind, I've set out to improve my other web projects with their
            intended design languages, so it will take a while for them to actually work.
            Same goes for this project, which has been the start of my web building
            journey since being booted off from Bookmark back in April 2022. (Read the
            <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/blog/20220413" target="_blank"></a> to see
            what I mean.) It had gone through several iterations that I had to separate
            them into different classifications: Pre-Overhaul and Post-Overhaul.
            <b>This time, it'll be much different.</b>
          </p>
          <h2><code>mamanyosquad_preview</code></h2>
          <p>
            Now a lot of you who have a keen eye have noticed that I have provisioned a
            new repository on our GitHub Organizations page. The main reason I want to
            deal with this is that I'll be drafting what will be the new look of the
            website.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, it will provide a "unified" design language that encompasses what
            I've learned from all attempts at web development -- seeing that I've made
            some progress in my other projects, with others currently in the works.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consequently, some elements will be migrated over to the new framework; so I
            have to do some trial-and-error in order to get it to work seamlessly when the
            time comes that it'll be forwarded to upstream.
          </p>
          <button onclick="window.open('https://github.com/MamaNyoSquad/mamanyosquad-preview')">Check out the repository</button>
          <h3>What makes it different from the main repository?</h3>
          <p>
            <code>mamanyosquad-preview</code> is split into different branches which
            encompasses different iterations (called versions) of the website we're
            currently working on (not just my own). In essence, it will be useful when
            there are events that will take place on this platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to accompany such results, we've provisioned two underlying
            technologies to make this work: GitHub Codespaces and Nginx! Thanks to these
            technologies, we the SquadMates (and fellow frontend developers who want to
            contribute to these iterations) will be able to preview the changes seamlessly
            from a codespace dedicated to each branch! (I'll be providing the proper
            documentation once things settle down in order to get started with the
            codespace.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite everything, we're still using the same licensing metadata from
            upstream (MIT and CC-BY-4.0).
          </p>
          <h3>NEW: Web Versioning</h3>
          <p>
            As stipulated above, we'll be utilizing our web versioning in order to
            identify which branch of <code>mamanyosquad-preview</code> is actively being
            used on upstream (AKA this website). We'll be using the versioning format
            <code>branchname.xx.yy</code>, where:
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>branchname</code> refers to the branch being used on upstream, usually denoted in YYYYMMDD format</li>
              <li><code>xx</code> refers to any major version (any commit that has the MAJOR tag in upstream's PR)</li>
              <li><code>yy</code> refers to any minor version (any commit that has the MINOR tag in upstream's PR)</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            There are rules that encompass how this format works, which will be made
            available in the Preview's documentation.
          </p>
          <h3>Wait -- what will happen to the current iteration?</h3>
          <p>
            Don't worry -- while the current upstream will be overwritten any time soon,
            its underlying code can still be accessible via the Commits page; and its
            framework will be migrated over to Preview following its base versioning
            format!
          </p>
          <h2>#MamaNyoSquad Publishing</h2>
          <p>
            #MamaNyoSquad Publishing will have its own dedicated repository in the coming
            weeks/months in order to identify itself away from upstream's framework, which
            means it will have its own set that will accommodate the readers through its
            published works. Through the power of the Progressive Web App (PWA), readers
            can enjoy streamlined experience whether they are on Mobile or Desktops.
          </p>
          <p>
            With regards to its publications, they will be re-evaluated for any possible
            spelling-and-grammar errors to be easily readable when they return to the
            website. It should be noted that starting from "Romantic Perception" (Inside
            Story no.6), all publications will stay on the website as to migrate away from
            newsletters following Revue's shutdown on 18 Jan 2023.
          </p>
          <h3>Empty - Helena's Inside Story pt.2</h3>
          <p>
            On a related note, I'm proud to declare that the Inside Story no.7 --
            titled "Empty" -- is done as of 20 May! I can't believe it's
            been more than TWO YEARS since I first provisioned this story as the newest
            addition to the Inside Story lineup, which was bombarded with uncertainties
            following my venture as a VTuber. But since I loved DOAXVV to the core and
            wanted to thrive more than I should, I still pushed through and finally
            completed it against all odds!
          </p>
          <p>You can access this Inside Story (and the others) via the button below:</p>
          <button onclick="window.open('https://bit.ly/VIDiariesInsideStory')">Inside Stories (Docs Format)</button>
          <h3>What about <code>vidiaries-app</code>?</h3>
          <p>
            Upon realizing the existence of PWAs, I had to make a difficult decision to
            retire the said repository. Another reason for such a retirement is that it
            puts much strain on developing apps via the Android Studio platform where it
            may be uncertain to be compatible with other platforms, like iOS.
          </p>
          <p>
            The importance at this current state is to ensure cross-compatibility with all
            devices regardless of operating systems and device specifications, which is
            currently possible with PWA.
          </p>
          <p>
            Don't worry -- the archival of the repository is still ways off in
            expectations that some web elements dependent on it may break, so it'll give
            me more time to polish the final preview release (with migrated URLs). I'll
            send over the archival state in the foreseeable future.
          </p>
          <h2>Regarding the X Platform...</h2>
          <p>
            We just oversaw the change that may be drastic in the long run:
            <b
              ><code>twitter.com</code> has been officially renamed to
              <code>x.com</code>.</b
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            First off, we've been focusing on the website's R&D that we haven't updated
            much on the X Platform (formerly Twitter). However, we have some minor updates
            that we may consider in the long run:
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Updating of profile graphics (mostly accommodating the 96 DPI standard)</li>
              <li>Promotional graphics using publicly-available assets from DOAXVV PR (mostly Global)</li>
              <li>Updated birthday greetings for Venuses and their Seiyuus (Nyotengu and Satou Akemi take priority)</li>
              <li>Maintenance Routine deliveries</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            Second, we'll be utilizing our X account like what we used to before: Engaging
            in events like DOAXVV Event Showcases and Community Events. However, the
            latter may be still in questioning as to not cause an upheaval within our
            communities because of the SquadMates' past infractions; so we'll be careful
            in conducting such events moving forward.
          </p>
          <p>
            Third, our presence on X in relation to our website is hindered by our
            non-option to the platform's Premium services. In turn, we just noticed that
            our Embedded Timelines are not showing in contrast to @doax_vv_staff's (since
            the latter is opted to such). We might invest in Premium Services (starting
            from base Premium, not Basic) in order to restore the Embedded Timelines
            service in a foreseeable future, but it comes at a cost of our expenses. We'll
            let you know in the coming moments via subsequent posts on X or blogs here on
            this website.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fourth, in order to conform to the domain change as stated above, the
            <code>widgets.js</code> has been modified -- replacing "twitter" with "X".
            Most of the functions/classes remain unchanged, however, as to not break the
            appearance of X Embedded Web services. We might opt to restore the original
            format whenever we see fit or otherwise pursuant to our legal implications
            outlined in our Policies.
          </p>
          <h2>So... what's next?!</h2>
          <p>
            Now that we got the necessary info out, what's really next for #MamaNyoSquad?
            Honestly, it's still ways off until it can be described as one of the ultimate
            DEAD OR ALIVE platforms to have ever existed. We still have some more features
            being baked in the oven, but at least we get to see what's going to be the
            next big thing.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm honestly looking forward to improving this website even more to
            accommodate more viewers and continue waving the flag -- bringing the essence
            of the series through DOAXVV and beyond!
          </p>
          <p>
            Now with more projects related to this one under my belt, I might need some
            more all-nighters to complete these at once (lol jk); but I hope that you
            enjoy reading this Blog nonetheless! Again, we'll be providing updates related
            to the website and our workflows where applicable.
