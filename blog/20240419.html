            This is <b>thebelovedmoon</b>; General Manager of #MamaNyoSquad, and long-time
            player of DOAXVV Global since
            <a
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              href="https://x.com/i/status/1331797563771547648"
              target="_blank"
            ></a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            I first started this game out of curiosity and since I'm bored and have
            nothing to do, but then it quickly spiraled into one of the games that I play
            on a daily basis. And I have to say; the more I play the game, the more I
            appreciate the efforts the Staff put out on this venture -- big or small. It
            introduced me to a world unlike any other, where different circumstances and
            experiences collide to form an uncertainty that only we can imagine.
          </p>
          <p>
            And during those times, in my perspective, I've seen a lot happening with my
            own eyes; from PC switching to retiring of some in-game features that mattered
            to the game, I've seen many evolutions that redefine what is DOAXVV at its
            core without straying away from its intended purpose.
          </p>
          <p>
            And along the way, it gave me a mission to get the word out about further
            activities of the game. I mean, we already have
            <a
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              href="https://x.com/doax_vv_staff"
              target="_blank"
            ></a>
            (Japanese Edition) to make up for that, but what about its other counterpart?
            With that in mind, I decided to achieve the impossible -- to give the Global
            Edition its own platform in places where it hadn't shown its full potential,
            specifically Twitter (currently X).
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>
              With it, I introduced the world to DOAXVV Global through #MamaNyoSquad -- a
              platform dedicated to DOAXVV, the DOA Series, and beyond.
            </b>
          </p>
          <p>
            I have never been more grateful than having to introduce a platform in which
            both Editions can showcase in harmony, and all of it was thanks to all the
            hard work of what the DOAXVV Development Staff has produced over the years. It
            has already became my sanctuary for all my upcoming projects to let the world
            know more about the quirks of the Series, and how we as fans appreciate more
            about it.
          </p>
          <p>
            To it, I send my thanks -- on behalf of the SquadMates -- to the DOAXVV Global
            Development Staff for providing more than just what was required to appreciate
            the game at its core. Despite the hurdles, you all go beyond the expectations
            -- providing us players with more than just swimsuits and event stories, but
            the connections that matter to the Venuses and everyone in between.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my perspective, I'm very excited on what you all can build next. I'm
            looking forward to more exciting days together with the game (even though I
            suffered many times in the Gacha alone), and wishing everyone all the best!!
          </p>
