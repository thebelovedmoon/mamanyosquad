          <h1>An Open Letter to Twitter</h1>
          <span>20 Nov 2022</span>
          <br><br><br>
          <p>
            Twitter has became the home of many opportunities that we don't know is
            possible. From memes to information about certain brands, and beyond -- it
            became the hub of what's known as the "Town Square of the People".
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, we won't even forget its mishaps and things that reshaped the
            platform throughout the years on a negative note -- drama, controversies, and
            even as far as exploitations that harm the users.
          </p>
          <p>
            We just learned about what happened with the management a few days ago, and we
            are very optimistic at first with the new management -- only to realize the
            scathed reality of it being its own pile of mess because of demanding
            workflows and things that other employees think is not really necessary to
            implement in the first place. Despite this, we still kept on our optimistic
            approach that things would turn around despite those events.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the course of these events that are currently unfolding, the public eye
            has already interpreted it as the "End of an Era for Twitter" as they deem
            know it. But on a personal level, we would say that we have grown much that
            we're establishing ourselves in our own right despite our accounts only being
            in the platform for a while. So, it's still in the best interest that we'll be
            staying on this platform while we work on other options.
          </p>
          <p>
            But, there won't be an Open Letter like this without any demands and/or
            questions, so let's get down with it:
          </p>
          <p>
            First off, why the layoff of the employees for such an overwhelming demand? If
            you're desperately trying to improve the services for the greater good of the
            people, then how come the employees are leaving en masse? Surely there's
            something wrong with the atmosphere, or -- as we've looked into the details as
            it unfolds -- it may be because of the demands that the employees can't stand
            it anymore.
          </p>
          <p>
            Second, the verification procedures and how Twitter Blue is connected to it.
            We've seen users being verified because they're subscribed to Twitter Blue,
            which caused a lot of dismay for others. In other cases, some critics pointed
            out that people who are on the negative side of things (like being scrutinized
            and/or accused of certain allegations that critics see fit) that deter
            public's interest with certain topics are verified because of this change. We
            understand the case as to how it's implemented, but why? We're supposed to
            believe that notability plays a big factor in determining if we should get
            verified.
          </p>
          <p>
            Third, management issues and recent receptions from the public eye. We're
            recently become aware that recent layoffs (as pointed in the first factor)
            caused an upheaval across the public, and they firmly believe that the upper
            management are to be blamed for all the chaos -- which also are underpinned by
            constant memes surrounding the "alleged" demise of the platform. Would you
            firmly believe it was the case? Are there any other options that could
            possibly turn things around for the better good? As far as we're concerned, we
            also don't want this legacy to perish because of such issues, but what can we
            do about it?
          </p>
          <p>
            Fourth, combat to scrutiny. As we're writing this, there's already the news
            stating that the Former President that encouraged the insurrection against the
            White House and the Electoral College last 6 Jan 2021 -- Donald Trump -- will
            have his Twitter account reinstated back again by Mr. Musk. (By the time of
            issuance there's a high chance that it already has been done.) How would you
            -- as a company -- respond to such scrutinies, and how would you prevent such
            from happening that deter public interest -- without considering profits to
            boot? And what policies should be done in order to make this work?
          </p>
          <p>
            And fifth, the continuous development of the platform following the mass
            exodus. As per our findings, if these events keep happening, there's a high
            chance that it will become underdeveloped and out-of-date -- security
            vulnerabilities (commonly referred as being CVEs), if left unpatched, may
            leave the platform compromised. It's understandable that more people are
            needed to combat such vulnerabilities, but with this event still ongoing, how
            will you combat such?
          </p>
          <p>
            We understood that the new management will be tough, and we sympathize with
            you; but let's not forget that these (and other factors) exist and we need to
            maintain as much as we can in order for it to thrive further. Not to mention,
            having some adjustments to some features in response to the situation, but
            keeping some of the most important factors into consideration.
          </p>
          <p>
            We firmly believe and hope that there's still some good way out without some
            of these overwhelming demands and mass exodus happening on every corner. We
            might not know what might that be, and what changes you might implement as a
            platform, but let's hope that the values we shared throughout the years remain
            the same.
