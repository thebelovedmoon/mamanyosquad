          <p>This is <b>Emmannuel Ortega</b>, Social & Web Manager for #MamaNyoSquad.</p>
          <p>
            I have been a part of the SINoALICE universe since its inception on July 2020,
            and since then I have been committed to enriching its experience through my
            expertise. This game have been a major factor in bringing the universes
            together for a never-ending desire, something that I have been looking forward
            to since its inception.
          </p>
          <p>
            It began when one of the closest people I associate myself with has introduced
            me to it, and she has ushered her own efforts along with it. That gave me an
            interest in trying that out, and soon I became hooked on to it. Although we
            could not talk about it anymore since she has since been disappeared without a
            trace. However, her spirit will always linger with me and I will continue her
            journey through countless efforts and determination through this game.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>
              And in addition, she became one of what I call the Circles, something that I
              will be cherishing for generations to come. That is why I founded the
              <b>「Seal of the Circle (SotC)」</b> to repay my gratitude towards two of
              the people whom I associate with, that I loved deeply in my heart.
            </i>
          </p>
          <p>
            My story had become livelier when I realized one of the characters in the
            game—Snow White—perfectly fits my vision of taking matters with prejudice and
            consideration, where impartiality becomes the basis for a rational approach to
            every situation.
          </p>
          <p>
            And I vowed, moving forward, that I will represent as the endeared Symbol of
            Justice.
          </p>
          <p>
            During my experience with SINoALICE, I have a Guild named 「TheLonelyBride」,
            which initially was attributed to one of the Classes associated with Snow
            White; specifically the Cleric class, where she endowed herself in an
            alternative revision of a wedding dress. However, that has changed when she
            debuted later in her Mage class—something that shocked the community as she
            endowed in an elegant literal wedding dress itself. This, complete with a
            stamp titled 「Snow White/Bride」, has made me stuck upon for the remainder of
            my experiences as a whole, while becoming as one of the Players who represent
            Snow White.
          </p>
          <p>
            Those experiences, among other instances that I did not mention in this
            Message, are what I will be taking with when the Global Edition finally seals
            the Library into a halt. The memories and experiences I had with it became a
            foundation that will be inherited by the ideas that I will populate in its
            honor.
          </p>
          <p>
            To every Guild that I have fought a battle on in the Colosseum, to every
            Player whom I had a co-op battle with, to everyone who have stuck with the
            community to its final breath, I thank you for your never-ending commitment in
            harnessing the stories from within.
          </p>
          <p>
            To SQUARE ENIX and Pokelabo: Without both of your efforts, SINoALICE would not
            have been possible. Your commitment to ensuring quality on your game has been
            one of the biggest factors in which I loved, and I hope that will carry on
            with your future endeavors. ありがとうございます。
          </p>
          <p>
            To those who have read to the very end of this Message, I hope you can support
            SINoALICE Global to the very end. You can find them on Twitter / X at
            <b>@sinoaliceglobal</b>, or play the game along with me to the end.
            <b>Let us wander around the Library for the final time.</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            And, before I can conclude this Message:
            <b>I will not be going anywhere.</b> As soon as Pokelabo pulls the plug on
            Global Edition, I will be around on the Japanese Edition. So, you can expect
            the same experiences as it would during my first experiences on the former.
          </p>
