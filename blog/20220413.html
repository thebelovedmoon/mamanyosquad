          <h1>An Open Letter to Bookmark</h1>
          <span>13 Apr 2022</span>
          <br><br><br>
          <p>
            We, whom have been your loyal customers on the platform, are saddened by the
            sudden concurrent changes that has affected our workflows. It has been such a
            pain to be able to maintain our social presence across the Internet without
            worrying when our features are going to be limited anytime soon. And most
            importantly, we're in a deep worry that due to the new pricing guidelines, our
            free websites--like this one--is bound to be deleted soon. (we've made backups
            of it just in case, so that we won't lose any hard work, but nonetheless.)
          </p>
          <p>
            As such, we've been staying on this platform for many months (if not a year or
            two), freely customizing our websites as we wish without any worry of
            limitations. we've been so grateful to be provided many new features that will
            enhance the website experience, but that came at a cost: We need to pay to
            utilize the advanced services and keep our websites active.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, we understand that these paid services are the 'keys' to improving the
            site experience, but please understand that some customers of this platform
            can't stay longer because when their "Free Trial" ends, they MUST PAY to
            continue using the service; whereas themselves have a tight budget or have no
            budget at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because of these sudden changes, those who are in that sector have a choice to
            pay up to continue using the basic services after the trial, or remove from
            the platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before we move on, we just wanted to mention that restricting customizations
            is a real pain considering that some websites have individual customization
            settings before this sudden change, like in Emmannuel's case, in which he
            <a
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              href="https://x.com/i/status/1513791911919644675"
              target="_blank"
              >tweeted</a
            >
            at 8:11am UTC. In a nutshell, the websites after this update have restricted
            the customizations (like header and footer) to apply globally. What's worse is
            that unlike the last update [as we can remember] that you limited our free
            websites to 5, you haven't pushed future updates to your customers, which
            proves that the changes are sudden without their notice.
          </p>
          <p>
            We're appealing to Bookmark to reconsider other options considering the
            no-budget customers like us and features that we deem are demanding to be
            returned, amongst other considerations not mentioned in this open letter.
